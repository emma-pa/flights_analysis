# Flights data analysis and visualisation
The project aims at manipulating and processing a data set offered by a section of ASA. Data can be accessed [here](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/) and are used to answer the following questions  : 
* When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?
* Do older planes suffer more delays?

## About the project
